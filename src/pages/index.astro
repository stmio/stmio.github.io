      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Sam, a student from the West Midlands, UK, currently studying for my
        A-levels. In my spare time, I enjoy building and
        <a href={GITHUB_PROFILE_URL}>contributing to cool tech</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main interest lies in Computer Science and its overlap with the
        natural sciences and mathematics. CS can be used as a gateway to solving
        challenging problems in science, as well as
        <a href={MIT_CLIMATE_URL}>helping us to hit long-term climate goals</a>.
        I aspire to study Computer Science and further understand these topics
        at university.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most recently, I have been exploring data and Machine Learning in Python
        while working on building a Raspberry Pi weather station, which feeds
        its data to an ML model, to predict tomorrow morning's weather. In the
        past, I have built projects with JavaScript (and HTML/CSS), Python and
        C#. <em>
          Sometimes, I write about these projects in blog posts on this website!
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>Have a look at this short list of my most recent blog posts:</p>
      <ul>
        {
          posts
            .slice(-5)
            .reverse()
            .map((post) => (
              <li>
                <div class="post">
                  <div>
                    <a href={post.url}>{post.frontmatter.title}</a>
                  </div>
                  <code class="post-date hidden-mobile">
                    <time datetime={post.frontmatter.pubDate}>
                      {new Date(post.frontmatter.pubDate).toLocaleDateString(
                        "en-gb",
                        { year: "numeric", month: "short", day: "numeric" }
                      )}
                    </time>
                  </code>
                </div>
                {post.frontmatter.description && (
                  <div class="post-description nowrap">
                    {post.frontmatter.description}
                  </div>
                )}
              </li>
            ))
        }
