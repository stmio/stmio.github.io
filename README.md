# stmio.github.io

This is the repo for my [personal website and blog](https://stmio.net/), built with Astro.

It is based on the [Astro Micro](https://astro-micro.vercel.app/) theme, an extension to the popular [Astro Nano](https://astro-nano-demo.vercel.app/). 

The website has:
- [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app) for search
- [Giscus](https://giscus.app) for comments
- Full type safety with Typescript
- Markdown and MDX support for posts
- System, light and dark themes
- Blog post tags
- Projects pages
- An RSS feed
- A sitemap
- Tailwind support
- ...and more!

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
