# Introducing [Astro Micro ðŸ”¬](https://astro-micro.vercel.app/)

Astro Micro is an accessible theme for Astro. It's a fork of [Mark Horn's](https://github.com/markhorn-dev) popular theme [Astro Nano](https://astro-nano-demo.vercel.app/). Like Nano, Micro comes with zero frameworks installed.

Micro adds features like [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app) for search, [Giscus](https://giscus.app) for comments, and more. For a full list of changes, see this [blog post](https://astro-micro.vercel.app/blog/00-micro-changelog).

Micro still comes with everything great about Nano â€” full type safety, a sitemap, an RSS feed, and Markdown + MDX support. Styled with TailwindCSS and preconfigured with system, light, and dark themes.
